# go

```go
import "chaos-agent"
```

Description: This Go program connects to a remote VM via SSH, deploys a chaos testing binary, and listens for encrypted messages from the binary to log chaos events and update configuration files. It uses AES\-GCM for encryption and handles various message types including general logs, chaos reports, variable updates, and operation completion signals. It ensures secure communication using a randomly generated token and encryption key for each session. It also compiles the chaos binary with embedded configuration parameters and manages its lifecycle on the remote VM.
