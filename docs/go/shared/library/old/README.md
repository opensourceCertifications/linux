# library

```go
import "chaos-agent/shared/library/old"
```

Package library provides file manipulation utilities. It includes functions for cyclically jumbling file contents while preserving metadata. It ensures safe file operations by preventing path traversal and symlink attacks. It is designed for use in controlled environments where file integrity is critical.

## func [CyclicJumble](<https://github.com/opensourceCertifications/linux/blob/main/monitor/go/shared/library/old/file_jumble.go#L44>)

```go
func CyclicJumble(paths []string) error
```

CyclicJumble takes a list of absolute file paths \(regular files\) and performs a cycle: paths\[i\] content \-\> paths\[\(i\+1\)%n\] for all i.

It preserves each destination file's original metadata as much as possible: \- permissions \(mode\), ownership \(uid/gid\), atime/mtime, and extended attributes \(best\-effort\). \- Operations are atomic per destination via rename\(2\) of a same\-dir temp file. Notes/limits: \- ctime cannot be preserved on Linux. \- Non\-regular files \(dirs/symlinks/devices\) are rejected. \- Paths must be unique. CyclicJumble writes content of paths\[i\] into paths\[\(i\+1\)%n\], preserving the destination's metadata captured prior to the swap.
