Description: This Go program connects to a remote VM via SSH, deploys a chaos testing binary,
and listens for encrypted messages from the binary to log chaos events and update configuration files.
It uses AES-GCM for encryption and handles various message types including general logs, chaos reports, variable updates, and operation completion signals.
It ensures secure communication using a randomly generated token and encryption key for each session.
It also compiles the chaos binary with embedded configuration parameters and manages its lifecycle on the remote VM.
